  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">He\nhad not hesitated long. Physical fitness was his gospel. On the\nsubject of exercise he was confessedly a crank. He decided to\ndefy London.</p><p>The first time he appeared in Arundell Street in his sweater and\nflannels he had barely whirled his Indian clubs once around his\nhead before he had attracted the following audience:</p><p>a Two cabmen—one intoxicated;       )</p><p>b Four waiters from the Hotel Mathis;       )</p><p>c Six waiters from the Hotel Previtali;       )</p><p>d Six chambermaids from the Hotel Mathis;       )</p><p>e Five chambermaids from the Hotel Previtali;       )</p><p>f The proprietor of the Hotel Mathis;       )</p><p>g The proprietor of the Hotel Previtali;       )</p><p>h A street cleaner;       )</p><p>i Eleven nondescript loafers;       )</p><p>j Twenty-seven children;       )</p><p>k A cat.       )</p>",

They still\nlaughed, but without that ringing conviction which the\nsympathetic support of their elders had lent them.</p><p>And now, after three months, the neighborhood, having accepted\nAshe and his morning exercises as a natural phenomenon, paid him\nno further attention.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">On this particular morning Ashe Marson skipped with even more\nthan his usual vigor. This was because he wished to expel by\nmeans of physical fatigue a small devil of discontent, of whose\npresence within him he had been aware ever since getting out of\nbed. It is in the Spring that the ache for the larger life comes\non us, and this was a particularly mellow Spring morning. It</p>",
  "page-18": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was\nthe sort of morning when the air gives us a feeling of\nanticipation—a feeling that, on a day like this, things surely\ncannot go jogging along in the same dull old groove; a\npremonition that something romantic and exciting is about to\nhappen to us.</p><p>But the southwest wind of Spring brings also remorse. We catch\nthe vague spirit of unrest in the air and we regret our misspent\nyouth.</p><p>Ashe was doing this. Even as he skipped, he was conscious of a\nwish that he had studied harder at college and was now in a\nposition to be doing something better than hack work for a\nsoulless publishing company. Never before had he been so\ncompletely certain that he was sick to death of the rut into\nwhich he had fallen.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Skipping brought no balm. He threw down his rope and took up the\nIndian clubs. Indian clubs left him still unsatisfied. The\nthought came to him that it was a long time since he had done his\nLarsen Exercises. Perhaps</p>",

The only reason why King\nHenry, of England, whose son sank with the White Ship, never\nsmiled again, was because Lieutenant Larsen had not then invented\nhis admirable exercises.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So complacent, so insolently unselfconscious had Ashe become in\nthe course of three months, owing to his success in inducing the\npopulace to look on anything he did with the indulgent eye of\nunderstanding, that it simply did not occur to him, when he\nabruptly twisted his body into the shape of a corkscrew, in\naccordance with the directions in the lieutenant's book for the\nconsummation of Exercise</p>",

The proprietor of the Hotel Mathis regarded him\nwithout a smile. The proprietor of the Hotel Previtali might have\nbeen in a trance, for all the interest he displayed. The hotel\nemployees continued their tasks impassively. The children were\nblind and dumb. The cat across the way stropped its backbone\nagainst the railings unheeding.</p><p>But, even as he unscrambled himself and resumed a normal posture,\nfrom his immediate rear there rent the quiet morning air a clear\nand musical laugh. It floated out on the breeze and hit him like\na bullet.</p><p>Three months ago Ashe would have accepted the laugh as\ninevitable, and would have refused to allow it to embarrass him;\nbut long immunity from ridicule had sapped his resolution. He\nspun round with a jump, flushed and self-conscious.</p>",
  "page-21": "<p>From the window of the first-floor front of Number Seven a girl\nwas leaning.

Three months ago a million girls could have\nlaughed at his morning exercises without turning him from his\npurpose. Today this one scoffer, alone and unaided, was\nsufficient for his undoing. The depression which exercise had\nbegun to dispel surged back on him. He had no heart to continue.\nSadly gathering up his belongings, he returned to his room, and\nfound a cold bath tame and uninspiring.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The breakfasts—included in the rent—provided by Mrs. Bell, the\nlandlady of Number Seven, were held by</p>",

By the time Ashe had done his best\nwith the disheveled fried egg, the chicory blasphemously called\ncoffee, and the charred bacon, misery had him firmly in its grip.\nAnd when he forced himself to the table, and began to try to\nconcoct the latest of the adventures of Gridley Quayle,\nInvestigator, his spirit groaned within him.</p><p>This morning, as he sat and chewed his pen, his loathing for\nGridley seemed to have reached its climax. It was his habit, in\nwriting these stories, to think of a good title first, and then\nfit an adventure to it. And overnight, in a moment of\ninspiration, he had jotted down on an envelope the words: \"The\nAdventure of the Wand of Death.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was with the sullen repulsion of a vegetarian who finds a\ncaterpillar in his salad that he now sat glaring at</p>",
  "page-23": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">them.</p><p>The title had seemed so promising overnight—so full of strenuous\npossibilities. It was still speciously attractive; but now that\nthe moment had arrived for writing the story its flaws became\nmanifest.</p><p>What was a wand of death? It sounded good; but, coming down to\nhard facts, what was it? You cannot write a story about a wand of\ndeath without knowing what a wand of death is; and, conversely,\nif you have thought of such a splendid title you cannot jettison\nit offhand. Ashe rumpled his hair and gnawed his pen.</p><p>There came a knock at the door.</p><p>Ashe spun round in his chair. This was the last straw! If he had\ntold Mrs. Ball once that he was never to be disturbed in the\nmorning on any pretext whatsoever, he had told her twenty times.\nIt was simply too infernal to be endured if his work time was to\nbe cut into like this. Ashe ran over in his mind a few opening\nremarks.</p>",
  "page-24": "<p>\"Come in!\" he shouted, and braced himself for battle.</p><p>A girl walked in—the girl of the first-floor front; the girl\nwith the blue eyes, who had laughed at his Larsen Exercises.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Various circumstances contributed to the poorness of the figure\nAshe cut in the opening moments of this interview. In the first\nplace, he was expecting to see his landlady, whose height was\nabout four feet six, and the sudden entry of somebody who was\nabout five feet seven threw the universe temporarily out of\nfocus. In the second place, in anticipation of Mrs. Bell's entry,\nhe had twisted his face into a forbidding scowl, and it was no\nslight matter to change this on the spur of the moment into a\npleasant smile. Finally, a man who has been sitting for half an\nhour in front of a sheet of paper bearing the words: \"The\nAdventure of the Wand of Death,\" and trying to decide what a wand\nof death</p>",
  "page-25": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">might be, has not his mind under proper control.</p><p>The net result of these things was that, for perhaps half a\nminute, Ashe behaved absurdly. He goggled and he yammered. An\nalienist, had one been present, would have made up his mind about\nhim without further investigation. For an appreciable time he did\nnot think of rising from his seat. When he did, the combined leap\nand twist he executed practically amounted to a Larsen Exercise.</p><p>Nor was the girl unembarrassed. If Ashe had been calmer he would\nhave observed on her cheek the flush which told that she, too,\nwas finding the situation trying. But, woman being ever better\nequipped with poise than man, it was she who spoke first.</p><p>\"I'm afraid I'm disturbing you.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"No, no!\" said Ashe. \"Oh, no; not at all—not at all! No. Oh,\nno—not at all—no!\" And would have continued to play on the\ntheme indefinitely had not the</p>",
  "page-26": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">girl spoken again.</p><p>\"I wanted to apologize,\" she said, \"for my abominable rudeness in\nlaughing at you just now. It was idiotic of me and I don't know\nwhy I did it. I'm sorry.\"</p><p>Science, with a thousand triumphs to her credit, has not yet\nsucceeded in discovering the correct reply for a young man to\nmake who finds himself in the appalling position of being\napologized to by a pretty girl. If he says nothing he seems\nsullen and unforgiving. If he says anything he makes a fool of\nhimself. Ashe, hesitating between these two courses, suddenly\ncaught sight of the sheet of paper over which he had been poring\nso long.</p><p>\"What is a wand of death?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I beg your pardon?\"</p><p>\"A wand of death?\"</p><p>\"I don't understand.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The delirium of the conversation was too much for Ashe. He burst\nout laughing. A moment later the girl</p>",
  "page-27": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">did the same. And\nsimultaneously embarrassment ceased to be.</p><p>\"I suppose you think I'm mad?\" said Ashe.</p><p>\"Certainly,\" said the girl.</p><p>\"Well, I should have been if you hadn't come in.\"</p><p>\"Why was that?\"</p><p>\"I was trying to write a detective story.\"</p><p>\"I was wondering whether you were a writer.\"</p><p>\"Do you write?\"</p><p>\"Yes. Do you ever read Home Gossip?\"</p><p>\"Never!\"</p><p>\"You are quite right to speak in that thankful tone. It's a\nhorrid little paper—all brown-paper patterns and advice to the\nlovelorn and puzzles. I do a short story for it every week, under\nvarious names. A duke or an earl goes with each story. I loathe\nit intensely.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I am sorry for your troubles,\" said Ashe firmly; \"but we are\nwandering from the point. What is a wand of</p>",
  "page-28": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">death?\"</p><p>\"A wand of death?\"</p><p>\"A wand of death.\"</p><p>The girl frowned reflectively.</p><p>\"Why, of course; it's the sacred ebony stick stolen from the\nIndian temple, which is supposed to bring death to whoever\npossesses it. The hero gets hold of it, and the priests dog him\nand send him threatening messages. What else could it be?\"</p><p>Ashe could not restrain his admiration.</p><p>\"This is genius!\"</p><p>\"Oh, no!\"</p><p>\"Absolute genius. I see it all. The hero calls in Gridley Quayle,\nand that patronizing ass, by the aid of a series of wicked\ncoincidences, solves the mystery; and there am I, with another\nmonth's work done.\"</p><p>She looked at him with interest.</p><p>\"Are you the author of Gridley Quayle?\"</p>",
  "page-29": "<p>\"Don't tell me you read him!\"</p><p>\"I do not read him! But he is published by the same firm that\npublishes Home Gossip, and I can't help seeing his cover\nsometimes while I am waiting in the waiting room to see the\neditress.\"</p><p>Ashe felt like one who meets a boyhood's chum on a desert island.\nHere was a real bond between them.</p><p>\"Does the Mammoth publish you, too? Why, we are comrades in\nmisfortune—fellow serfs! We should be friends. Shall we be\nfriends?\"</p><p>\"I should be delighted.\"</p><p>\"Shall we shake hands, sit down, and talk about ourselves a\nlittle?\"</p><p>\"But I am keeping you from your work.\"</p><p>\"An errand of mercy.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She sat down. It is a simple act, this of sitting down; but, like\neverything else, it may be an index to character. There was\nsomething wholly satisfactory to Ashe in the</p>",
  "page-30": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">manner in which this\ngirl did it. She neither seated herself on the extreme edge of\nthe easy-chair, as one braced for instant flight; nor did she\nwallow in the easy-chair, as one come to stay for the week-end.\nShe carried herself in an unconventional situation with an\nunstudied self-confidence that he could not sufficiently admire.</p><p>Etiquette is not rigid in Arundell Street; but, nevertheless, a\ngirl in a first-floor front may be excused for showing surprise\nand hesitation when invited to a confidential chat with a\nsecond-floor front young man whom she has known only five\nminutes. But there is a freemasonry among those who live in large\ncities on small earnings.</p><p>\"Shall we introduce ourselves?\" said Ashe. \"Or did Mrs. Bell tell\nyou my name? By the way, you have not been here long, have you?\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I took my room day before yesterday. But your</p>",

  "page-52": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">perhaps even more\njovial with chance acquaintances. It was estimated by envious\nintimates that his joviality with chance acquaintances, specially\nwith young men of the upper classes, with large purses and small\nforeheads—was worth hundreds of pounds a year to him. There was\nsomething about his comfortable appearance and his jolly manner\nthat irresistibly attracted a certain type of young man.

Collecting had become a habit with\nhim, but he was not yet a real enthusiast. It occurred to him\nthat the time had arrived for a certain amount of pruning and\nelimination. He called in an expert and bade him go through the\ncollection and weed out what he felicitously termed the</p>",
  "page-84": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">\"dead\nones.\" The expert did his job thoroughly. When he had finished,\nthe collection was reduced to a mere dozen specimens.</p><p>\"The rest,\" he explained, \"are practically valueless.

  "page-85": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">went to the\nbathroom, where he bathed his temples with eau de Cologne.</p><p>That talk changed J. Preston Peters from a supercilious\nscooper-up of random scarabs to what might be called a genuine\nscarab fan. It does not matter what a man collects; if Nature has\ngiven him the collector's mind he will become a fanatic on the\nsubject of whatever collection he sets out to make. Mr. Peters\nhad collected dollars; he began to collect scarabs with precisely\nthe same enthusiasm. He would have become just as enthusiastic\nabout butterflies or old china if he had turned his thoughts to\nthem; but it chanced that what he had taken up was the collecting\nof the scarab, and it gripped him more and more as the years went\non.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Gradually he came to love his scarabs with that love, surpassing\nthe love of women, which only collectors know. He became an\nexpert on those curious relics of a dead civilization. For a time\nthey ran neck and neck in</p>",
  "page-86": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">his thoughts with business. When he\nretired from business he was free to make them the master passion\nof his life. He treasured each individual scarab in his\ncollection as a miser treasures gold.</p><p>Collecting, as Mr. Peters did it, resembles the drink habit. It\nbegins as an amusement and ends as an obsession. He was gloating\nover his treasures when the maid announced Lord Emsworth.</p><p>A curious species of mutual toleration—it could hardly be\ndignified by the title of friendship—had sprung up between these\ntwo men, so opposite in practically every respect. Each regarded\nthe other with that feeling of perpetual amazement with which we\nencounter those whose whole viewpoint and mode of life is foreign\nto our own.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The American's force and nervous energy fascinated Lord Emsworth.\nAs for Mr. Peters, nothing like the earl had ever happened to him\nbefore in a long and varied</p>",
  "page-87": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">life. Each, in fact, was to the other\na perpetual freak show, with no charge for admission. And if\nanything had been needed to cement the alliance it would have\nbeen supplied by the fact that they were both collectors.</p><p>They differed in collecting as they did in everything else. Mr.\nPeters' collecting, as has been shown, was keen, furious,\nconcentrated; Lord Emsworth's had the amiable dodderingness that\nmarked every branch of his life. In the museum at Blandings\nCastle you could find every manner of valuable and valueless\ncurio. There was no central motive; the place was simply an\namateur junk shop. Side by side with a Gutenberg Bible for which\nrival collectors would have bidden without a limit, you would\ncome on a bullet from the field of Waterloo, one of a consignment\nof ten thousand shipped there for the use of tourists by a\nBirmingham firm. Each was equally attractive to its owner.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"My dear Mr. Peters,\" said Lord Emsworth sunnily,</p>",

Joan remembered Aline of old,\nand knew her for a perennial victim of small troubles. Even in\ntheir schooldays she had always needed to be looked after and\ncomforted.

  "page-163": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">are not willing you\ncan leave it—and go to the devil! Sit down.\"</p><p>Ashe sat down. He resented the little man's tone, but this was\nnot the moment for saying so. His companion scrutinized him\nnarrowly.</p><p>\"So far as appearance goes,\" he said, \"you are what I want.\" Ashe\nfelt inclined to bow. \"Whoever takes on this job has got to act\nas my valet, and you look like a valet.\" Ashe felt less inclined\nto bow.</p><p>\"You're tall and thin and ordinary-looking. Yes; so far as\nappearance goes, you fill the bill.\"</p><p>It seemed to Ashe that it was time to correct an impression the\nlittle man appeared to have formed.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I am afraid,\" he said, \"if all you want is a valet, you will\nhave to look elsewhere. I got the idea from your advertisement\nthat something rather more exciting was in the air. I can\nrecommend you to several good employment agencies if you wish.\"\nHe rose.</p>",
  "page-164": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">\"Good-morning!\" he said.</p><p>He would have liked to fling the massive pewter inkwell at this\nlittle creature who had so keenly disappointed him.</p><p>\"Sit down!\" snapped the other.</p><p>Ashe resumed his seat. The hope of adventure dies hard on a\nSpring morning when one is twenty-six, and he had the feeling\nthat there was more to come.</p><p>\"Don't be a damned fool!\" said the little man. \"Of course I'm not\nasking you to be a valet and nothing else.\"</p><p>\"You would want me to do some cooking and plain sewing on the\nside, perhaps?\"</p><p>Their eyes met in a hostile glare. The flush on the little man's\nface deepened.</p><p>\"Are you trying to get fresh with me?\" he demanded dangerously.</p><p>\"Yes,\" said Ashe.</p>",
  "page-165": "<p>The answer seemed to disconcert his adversary. He was silent for\na moment.</p><p>\"Well,\" he said at last, \"maybe it's all for the best. If you\nweren't full of gall probably you wouldn't have come here at all;\nand whoever takes on this job of mine has got to have gall if he\nhas nothing else. I think we shall suit each other.\"</p><p>\"What is the job?\"</p><p>The little man's face showed doubt and perplexity.</p><p>\"It's awkward. If I'm to make the thing clear to you I've got to\ntrust you. And I don't know a thing about you. I wish I had\nthought of that before I inserted the advertisement.\"</p><p>Ashe appreciated the difficulty.</p><p>\"Couldn't you make an A—B case out of it?\"</p><p>\"Maybe I could if I knew what an A—B case was.\"</p><p>\"Call the people mixed up in it A and B.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"And forget, halfway through, who was which! No;</p>",
  "page-166": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">I guess I'll\nhave to trust you.\"</p><p>\"I'll play square.\"</p><p>The little man fastened his eyes on Ashe's in a piercing stare.\nAshe met them smilingly. His spirits, always fairly cheerful, had\nrisen high by now. There was something about the little man, in\nspite of his brusqueness and ill temper, which made him feel\nflippant.</p><p>\"Pure white!\" said Ashe.</p><p>\"Eh?\"</p><p>\"My soul! And this\"—he thumped the left section of his\nwaistcoat—\"solid gold. You may fire when ready, Gridley.\nProceed, professor.\"</p><p>\"I don't know where to begin.\"</p><p>\"Without presuming to dictate, why not at the beginning?\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"It's all so darned complicated that I don't rightly know which\nis the beginning.

  "page-167": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">scarabs. I'm\ncrazy about scarabs. Ever since I quit business, you might say\nthat I have practically lived for scarabs.\"</p><p>\"Though it sounds like an unkind thing to say of anyone,\" said\nAshe. \"Incidentally, what are scarabs?\" He held up his hand.\n\"Wait! It all comes back to me. Expensive classical education,\nnow bearing belated fruit. Scarabaeus—Latin; noun, nominative—a\nbeetle. Scarabaee—vocative—O you beetle! Scarabaeum—\naccusative—the beetle. Scarabaei—of the beetle. Scarabaeo—to\nor for the beetle. I remember now. Egypt—Rameses—pyramids—\nsacred scarabs! Right!\"</p><p>\"Well, I guess I've gotten together the best collection of\nscarabs outside the British Museum, and some of them are worth\nwhat you like to me.

  "page-169": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">innocent, and only sparing that portion of\ntheir property which was too heavy for him to carry away. Mr.\nPeters, indeed, specifically described the Earl of Emsworth as an\noily old second-story man.</p><p>It took Ashe some little time to get a thorough grasp of the\ntangled situation; but he did it at last.</p><p>Only one point perplexed him.</p><p>\"You want to hire somebody to go to this castle and get this\nscarab back for you. I follow that. But why must he go as your\nvalet?\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"That's simple enough. You don't think I'm asking him to buy a\nblack mask and break in, do you? I'm making it as easy for him as\npossible. I can't take a secretary down to the castle, for\neverybody knows that, now I've retired, I haven't got a\nsecretary; and if I engaged a new one and he was caught trying to\nsteal my scarab from the earl's collection, it would look\nsuspicious. But a valet is different. Anyone can get</p>",
  "page-170": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">fooled by a\ncrook valet with bogus references.\"</p><p>\"I see. There's just one other point: Suppose your accomplice\ndoes get caught—what then?\"</p><p>\"That,\" said Mr. Peters, \"is the catch; and it's just because of\nthat I am offering good pay to my man. We'll suppose, for the\nsake of argument, that you accept the contract and get caught.\nWell, if that happens you've got to look after yourself. I\ncouldn't say a word. If I did it would all come out, and so far\nas the breaking off of my daughter's engagement to young\nThreepwood is concerned, it would be just as bad as though I had\ntried to get the thing back myself.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"You've got to bear that in mind. You've got to remember it if\nyou forget everything else. I don't appear in this business in\nany way whatsoever. If you get caught you take what's coming to\nyou without a word. You can't turn round and say: 'I am innocent.\nMr. Peters will explain all'—because Mr. Peters certainly</p>",

You and I know that what\nyou are doing isn't really stealing; it's simply a tactful way of\ngetting back my own property. But the judge and jury will have\ndifferent views.\"</p><p>\"I am beginning to understand,\" said Ashe thoughtfully, \"why you\ncalled the job delicate and dangerous.\"</p><p>Certainly it had been no overstatement. As a writer of detective\nstories for the British office boy, he had imagined in his time\nmany undertakings that might be so described, but few to which\nthe description was more admirably suited.</p>",
  "page-172": "<p>\"It is,\" said Mr. Peters; \"and that is why I'm offering good pay.\nWhoever carries this job through gets one thousand pounds.\"</p><p>Ashe started.</p><p>\"One thousand pounds—five thousand dollars!\"</p><p>\"Five thousand.\"</p><p>\"When do I begin?\"</p><p>\"You'll do it?\"</p><p>\"For five thousand dollars I certainly will.\"</p><p>\"With your eyes open?\"</p><p>\"Wide open!\"</p><p>A look of positive geniality illuminated Mr. Peters' pinched\nfeatures.

  "page-173": "<p>There remained the telling of Joan Valentine; for it was\nobviously impossible not to tell her. When you have\nrevolutionized your life at the bidding of another you cannot\nwell conceal the fact, as though nothing had happened. Ashe had\nnot the slightest desire to conceal the fact. On the contrary, he\nwas glad to have such a capital excuse for renewing the\nacquaintance.</p><p>He could not tell her, of course, the secret details of the\nthing. Naturally those must remain hidden. No, he would just go\nairily in and say:</p><p>\"You know what you told me about doing something new?

It lacked the gay ease\nof their first interview. He was not apprehensive lest she might\nhave guessed his secret. There was, he felt, no possible means by\nwhich she could have done that. Yet the fact remained that those\nkeen blue eyes of hers were looking at him in a peculiar and\npenetrating manner. He felt damped.</p><p>\"It will be nice, being together,\" he said feebly.</p><p>\"Very!\" said Joan.</p>",

  "page-179": "<h4>Chapter V</h4><p class=\"  start-chapter\">The four-fifteen express slid softly out of Paddington Station\nand Ashe Marson settled himself in the corner seat of his\nsecond-class compartment. Opposite him Joan Valentine had begun\nto read a magazine. Along the corridor, in a first-class smoking\ncompartment, Mr. Peters was lighting a big black cigar. Still\nfarther along the corridor, in a first-class non-smoking\ncompartment, Aline Peters looked through the window and thought\nof many things.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In English trains the tipping classes travel first; valets,\nlady's maids, footmen, nurses, and head stillroom maids, second;\nand housemaids, grooms, and minor and</p>",
  "page-180": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">inferior stillroom maids,\nthird. But for these social distinctions, the whole fabric of\nsociety would collapse and anarchy stalk naked through the\nland—as in the United States.</p><p>Ashe was feeling remarkably light-hearted. He wished he had not\nbought Joan that magazine and thus deprived himself temporarily\nof the pleasure of her conversation; but that was the only flaw\nin his happiness. With the starting of the train, which might be\nconsidered the formal and official beginning of the delicate and\ndangerous enterprise on which he had embarked, he had definitely\ncome to the conclusion that the life adventurous was the life for\nhim. He had frequently suspected this to be the case, but it had\nrequired the actual experiment to bring certainty.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Almost more than physical courage, the ideal adventurer needs a\ncertain lively inquisitiveness, the quality of not being content\nto mind his own affairs;</p>",
  "page-181": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and in Ashe this quality was highly\ndeveloped. From boyhood up he had always been interested in\nthings that were none of his business. And it is just that\nattribute which the modern young man, as a rule, so sadly lacks.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The modern young man may do adventurous things if they are thrust\non him; but left to himself he will edge away uncomfortably and\nlook in the other direction when the goddess of adventure smiles\nat him. Training and tradition alike pluck at his sleeve and urge\nhim not to risk making himself ridiculous. And from sheer horror\nof laying himself open to the charge of not minding his own\nbusiness he falls into a stolid disregard of all that is out of\nthe ordinary and exciting. He tells himself that the shriek from\nthe lonely house he passed just now was only the high note of\nsome amateur songstress, and that the maiden in distress whom he\nsaw pursued by the ruffian with a knife was merely earning</p>",
  "page-182": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the\nsalary paid her by some motion-picture firm. And he proceeds on\nhis way, looking neither to left nor right.</p><p>Ashe had none of this degenerate coyness toward adventure. Though\nborn within easy distance of Boston and deposited by\ncircumstances in London, he possessed, nevertheless, to a\nremarkable degree, that quality so essentially the property of\nthe New Yorker—the quality known, for want of a more polished\nword, as rubber. It is true that it had needed the eloquence of\nJoan Valentine to stir him from his groove; but that was because\nhe was also lazy. He loved new sights and new experiences. Yes;\nhe was happy. The rattle of the train shaped itself into a lively\nmarch. He told himself that he had found the right occupation for\na young man in the Spring.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Joan, meantime, intrenched behind her magazine, was also busy\nwith her thoughts. She was not reading the magazine; she held it\nbefore her as a protection,</p>",
  "page-183": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">knowing that if she laid it down Ashe\nwould begin to talk. And just at present she had no desire for\nconversation. She, like Ashe, was contemplating the immediate\nfuture, but, unlike him, was not doing so with much pleasure. She\nwas regretting heartily that she had not resisted the temptation\nto uplift this young man and wishing that she had left him to\nwallow in the slothful peace in which she had found him.</p><p>It is curious how frequently in this world our attempts to\nstimulate and uplift swoop back on us and smite us like\nboomerangs. Ashe's presence was the direct outcome of her lecture\non enterprise, and it added a complication to an already\ncomplicated venture.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She did her best to be fair to Ashe. It was not his fault that he\nwas about to try to deprive her of five thousand dollars, which\nshe looked on as her personal property; but illogically she found\nherself feeling a little</p>",
  "page-184": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">hostile.</p><p>She glanced furtively at him over the magazine, choosing by ill\nchance a moment when he had just directed his gaze at her. Their\neyes met and there was nothing for it but to talk; so she tucked\naway her hostility in a corner of her mind, where she could find\nit again when she wanted it, and prepared for the time being to\nbe friendly. After all, except for the fact that he was her\nrival, this was a pleasant and amusing young man, and one for\nwhom, until he made the announcement that had changed her whole\nattitude toward him, she had entertained a distinct feeling of\nfriendship—nothing warmer.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There was something about him that made her feel that she would\nhave liked to stroke his hair in a motherly way and straighten\nhis tie, and have cozy chats with him in darkened rooms by the\nlight of open fires, and make him tell her his inmost thoughts,\nand</p>",
  "page-185": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">stimulate him to do something really worth while with his\nlife; but this, she held, was merely the instinct of a generous\nnature to be kind and helpful even to a comparative stranger.</p><p>\"Well, Mr. Marson,\" she said, \"Here we are!\"</p><p>\"Exactly what I was thinking,\" said Ashe.</p><p>He was conscious of a marked increase in the exhilaration the\nstarting of the expedition had brought to him. At the back of his\nmind he realized there had been all along a kind of wistful\nresentment at the change in this girl's manner toward him.\nDuring the brief conversation when he had told her of his having\nsecured his present situation, and later, only a few minutes\nback, on the platform of Paddington Station, he had sensed a\ncoldness, a certain hostility—so different from her pleasant\nfriendliness at their first meeting.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She had returned now to her earlier manner and he</p>",
  "page-186": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was surprised\nat the difference it made. He felt somehow younger, more alive.\nThe lilt of the train's rattle changed to a gay ragtime. This was\ncurious, because Joan was nothing more than a friend. He was not\nin love with her. One does not fall in love with a girl whom one\nhas met only three times. One is attracted—yes; but one does not\nfall in love.</p><p>A moment's reflection enabled him to diagnose his sensations\ncorrectly. This odd impulse to leap across the compartment and\nkiss Joan was not love. It was merely the natural desire of a\ngood-hearted young man to be decently chummy with his species.</p><p>\"Well, what do you think of it all, Mr. Marson?\" said Joan. \"Are\nyou sorry or glad that you let me persuade you to do this\nperfectly mad thing? I feel responsible for you, you know. If it\nhad not been for me you would have been comfortably in Arundell\nStreet, writing your Wand of Death.\"</p>",
  "page-187": "<p>\"I'm glad.\"</p><p>\"You don't feel any misgivings now that you are actually\ncommitted to domestic service?\"</p><p>\"Not one.\"</p><p>Joan, against her will, smiled approval on this uncompromising\nattitude. This young man might be her rival, but his demeanor on\nthe eve of perilous times appealed to her. That was the spirit\nshe liked and admired—that reckless acceptance of whatever might\ncome. It was the spirit in which she herself had gone into the\naffair and she was pleased to find that it animated Ashe\nalso—though, to be sure, it had its drawbacks. It made his\nrivalry the more dangerous. This reflection injected a touch of\nthe old hostility into her manner.</p><p>\"I wonder whether you will continue to feel so brave.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"</p>",
  "page-188": "<p>Joan perceived that she was in danger of going too far. She had\nno wish to unmask Ashe at the expense of revealing her own\nsecret. She must resist the temptation to hint that she had\ndiscovered his.</p><p>\"I meant,\" she said quickly, \"that from what I have seen of him\nMr. Peters seems likely to be a rather trying man to work for.\"</p><p>Ashe's face cleared. For a moment he had almost suspected that\nshe had guessed his errand.</p><p>\"Yes. I imagine he will be. He is what you might call\nquick-tempered. He has dyspepsia, you know.\"</p><p>\"I know.\"</p><p>\"What he wants is plenty of fresh air and no cigars, and a\nregular course of those Larsen Exercises that amused you so\nmuch.\"</p><p>Joan laughed.</p><p>\"Are you going to try and persuade Mr. Peters to twist himself\nabout like that? Do let me see it if you do.\"</p>",
  "page-189": "<p>\"I wish I could.\"</p><p>\"Do suggest it to him.\"</p><p>\"Don't you think he would resent it from a valet?\"</p><p>\"I keep forgetting that you are a valet.

You look so very strong and\nfit.\"</p><p>\"Surely there are muscular valets?\"</p><p>\"Well, yes; I suppose there are.\"</p><p>Ashe looked at her. He was thinking that never in his life had he\nseen a girl so amazingly pretty. What it was that she had done to\nherself was beyond him; but something, some trick of dress, had\ngiven her a touch of the demure that made her irresistible. She\nwas dressed in sober black, the ideal background for her\nfairness.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"While on the subject,\" he said, \"I suppose you know</p>",
  "page-190": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">you don't\nlook in the least like a lady's maid? You look like a disguised\nprincess.\"</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\"That's very nice of you, Mr. Marson, but you're quite wrong.\nAnyone could tell I was a lady's maid, a mile away. You aren't\ncriticizing the dress, surely?\"</p><p>\"The dress is all right. It's the general effect. I don't think\nyour expression is right. It's—it's—there's too much attack in\nit. You aren't meek enough.\"</p><p>Joan's eyes opened wide.</p><p>\"Meek! Have you ever seen an English lady's maid, Mr. Marson?\"</p><p>\"Why, no; now that I come to think of it, I don't believe I\nhave.\"</p><p>\"Well, let me tell you that meekness is her last quality. Why\nshould she be meek? Doesn't she go in after the groom of the\nchambers?\"</p><p>\"Go in? Go in where?\"</p>",
  "page-191": "<p>\"In to dinner.\" She smiled at the sight of his bewildered face.\n\"I'm afraid you don't know much about the etiquette of the new\nworld you have entered so rashly. Didn't you know that the rules\nof precedence among the servants of a big house in England are\nmore rigid and complicated than in English society?\"</p><p>\"You're joking!\"</p><p>\"I'm not joking. You try going in to dinner out of your proper\nplace when we get to Blandings and see what happens. A public\nrebuke from the butler is the least you could expect.\"</p><p>A bead of perspiration appeared on Ashe's forehead.</p><p>\"Heavens!\" he whispered. \"If a butler publicly rebuked me I think\nI should commit suicide. I couldn't survive it.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He stared, with fallen jaw, into the abyss of horror into which\nhe had leaped so light-heartedly. The servant problem, on this\nlarge scale, had been nonexistent for</p>",
  "page-192": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">him until now. In the days\nof his youth, at Mayling, Massachusetts, his needs had been\nministered to by a muscular Swede. Later, at Oxford, there had\nbeen his \"scout\" and his bed maker, harmless persons both,\nprovided you locked up your whisky. And in London, his last\nphase, a succession of servitors of the type of the disheveled\nmaid at Number Seven had tended him.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">That, dotted about the land of his adoption, there were houses in\nwhich larger staffs of domestics were maintained, he had been\nvaguely aware. Indeed, in \"Gridley Quayle, Investigator; the\nAdventure of the Missing Marquis\"—number four of the series—he\nhad drawn a picture of the home life of a duke, in which a butler\nand two powdered footmen had played their parts; but he had had\nno idea that rigid and complicated rules of etiquette swayed the\nprivate lives of these individuals. If he had given the matter a\nthought he had supposed that when the dinner hour arrived the\nbutler</p>",
  "page-193": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and the two footmen would troop into the kitchen and\nsquash in at the table wherever they found room.</p><p>\"Tell me,\" he said. \"Tell me all you know.

  "page-198": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">been\npassed; and that when they met again, if they ever did, it would\nbe as friends.

Joan read her magazine. Silence reigned in\nthe second-class compartment. Swindon was reached and passed.\nDarkness fell on the land. The journey began to seem interminable\nto Ashe; but presently there came a creaking of brakes and the\ntrain jerked itself to another stop. A voice on the platform made\nitself heard, calling:</p><p>\"Market Blandings! Market Blandings Station!\"</p><hr class=\"section\">",
  "page-199": "<p>The village of Market Blandings is one of those sleepy English\nhamlets that modern progress has failed to touch; except by the\naddition of a railroad station and a room over the grocer's shop\nwhere moving pictures are on view on Tuesdays and Fridays. The\nchurch is Norman and the intelligence of the majority of the\nnatives Paleozoic. To alight at Market Blandings Station in the\ndusk of a rather chilly Spring day, when the southwest wind has\nshifted to due east and the thrifty inhabitants have not yet lit\ntheir windows, is to be smitten with the feeling that one is at\nthe edge of the world with no friends near.</p><p>Ashe, as he stood beside Mr. Peters' baggage and raked the\nunsympathetic darkness with a dreary eye, gave himself up to\nmelancholy. Above him an oil lamp shed a meager light. Along the\nplatform a small but sturdy porter was juggling with a milk can.\nThe east wind explored Ashe's system with chilly fingers.</p>",
  "page-200": "<p>Somewhere out in the darkness into which Mr. Peters and Aline had\nalready vanished in a large automobile, lay the castle, with its\nbutler and its fearful code of etiquette. Soon the cart that was\nto convey him and the trunks thither would be arriving. He\nshivered.</p><p>Out of the gloom and into the feeble rays of the oil lamp came\nJoan Valentine. She had been away, tucking Aline into the car.\nShe looked warm and cheerful. She was smiling in the old friendly\nway.</p><p>If girls realized their responsibilities they would be so careful\nwhen they smiled that they would probably abandon the practice\naltogether. There are moments in a man's life when a girl's smile\ncan have as important results as an explosion of dynamite.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In the course of their brief acquaintance Joan had smiled at Ashe\nmany times, but the conditions governing those occasions had not\nbeen such as to permit him to be seriously affected. He had</p>",
  "page-201": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">been\npleased on such occasions; he had admired her smile in a detached\nand critical spirit; but he had not been overwhelmed by it. The\nframe of mind necessary for that result had been lacking.</p><p>Now, however, after five minutes of solitude on the depressing\nplatform of Market Blandings Station, he was what the\nspiritualists call a sensitive subject. He had reached that depth\nof gloom and bodily discomfort when a sudden smile has all the\neffect of strong liquor and good news administered\nsimultaneously, warming the blood and comforting the soul, and\ngenerally turning the world from a bleak desert into a land\nflowing with milk and honey.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It is not too much to say that he reeled before Joan's smile. It\nwas so entirely unexpected. He clutched Mr. Peters' steamer trunk\nin his emotion. All his resolutions to be cold and distant were\nswept away. He had the feeling that in a friendless universe here\nwas somebody</p>",
  "page-202": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">who was fond of him and glad to see him.</p><p>A smile of such importance demands analysis, and in this case\nrepays it; for many things lay behind this smile of Joan\nValentine's on the platform of Market Blandings Station.</p><p>In the first place, she had had another of her swift changes of\nmood, and had once again tucked away hostility into its corner.\nShe had thought it over and had come to the conclusion that as\nshe had no logical grievance against Ashe for anything he had\ndone to be distant to him was the behavior of a cat. Consequently\nshe resolved, when they should meet again, to resume her attitude\nof good-fellowship. That in itself would have been enough to make\nher smile.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There was another reason, however, which had nothing to do with\nAshe. While she had been tucking Aline into the automobile she\nmet the eye of the driver of that vehicle and had perceived a\ncurious look in it—a</p>",
  "page-203": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">look of amazement and sheer terror. A\nmoment, later, when Aline called the driver Freddie, she had\nunderstood. No wonder the Honorable Freddie had looked as though\nhe had seen a ghost.</p><p>It would be a relief to the poor fellow when, as he undoubtedly\nwould do in the course of the drive, he inquired of Aline the\nname of her maid and was told that it was Simpson. He would\nmutter something about \"Reminds me of a girl I used to know,\" and\nwould brood on the remarkable way in which Nature produces\ndoubles. But he had a bad moment, and it was partly at the\nrecollection of his face that Joan smiled.</p><p>A third reason was because the sight of the Honorable Freddie had\nreminded her that R. Jones had said he had written her poetry.\nThat thought, too, had contributed toward the smile which so\ndazzled Ashe.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Ashe, not being miraculously intuitive, accepted the easier\nexplanation that she smiled because she was glad</p>",
  "page-204": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to be in his\ncompany; and this thought, coming on top of his mood of despair\nand general dissatisfaction with everything mundane, acted on him\nlike some powerful chemical.</p><p>In every man's life there is generally one moment to which in\nlater years he can look back and say: \"In this moment I fell in\nlove!\" Such a moment came to Ashe now.</p><p>Betwixt the stirrup and the ground,\nMercy I asked; mercy I found.</p><p>So sings the poet and so it was with Ashe.</p><p>In the almost incredibly brief time it took the small but sturdy\nporter to roll a milk can across the platform and hump it, with a\nclang, against other milk cans similarly treated a moment before,\nAshe fell in love.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The word is so loosely used, to cover a thousand varying shades\nof emotion—from the volcanic passion of an Antony for a\nCleopatra to the tepid preference of</p>",

  "page-206": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Blandings to\nbecome suddenly congested with red Indians so that he might save\nJoan's life; and he did not wish to give up anything at all. But\nhe was conscious—to the very depths of his being—that a future\nin which Joan did not figure would be so insupportable as not to\nbear considering; and in the immediate present he very strongly\nfavored the idea of clasping Joan in his arms and kissing her\nuntil further notice.</p><p>Mingled with these feelings was an excited gratitude to her for\ncoming to him like this, with that electric smile on her face; a\nstunned realization that she was a thousand times prettier than\nhe had ever imagined; and a humility that threatened to make him\nloose his clutch on the steamer trunk and roll about at her feet,\nyapping like a dog.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Gratitude, so far as he could dissect his tangled emotion was the\npredominating ingredient of his mood. Only once in his life had\nhe felt so passionately</p>",
  "page-207": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">grateful to any human being. On that\noccasion, too, the object of his gratitude had been feminine.</p><p>Years before, when a boy in his father's home in distant Hayling,\nMassachusetts, those in authority had commanded that he—in his\neleventh year and as shy as one can be only at that interesting\nage—should rise in the presence of a roomful of strangers, adult\nguests, and recite \"The Wreck of the Hesperus.\"</p><p>He had risen. He had blushed. He had stammered. He had contrived\nto whisper: \"It was the Schooner Hesperus.\" And then, in a corner\nof the room, a little girl, for no properly explained reason, had\nburst out crying. She had yelled, she had bellowed, and would not\nbe comforted; and in the ensuing confusion Ashe had escaped to\nthe woodpile at the bottom of the garden, saved by a miracle.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">All his life he had remembered the gratitude he had felt for that\nlittle timely girl, and never until now had he</p>",
  "page-208": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">experienced any\nother similar spasm. But as he looked at Joan he found himself\nrenewing that emotion of fifteen years ago.</p><p>She was about to speak. In a sort of trance he watched her lips\npart. He waited almost reverently for the first words she should\nspeak to him in her new role of the only authentic goddess.</p><p>\"Isn't it a shame?\" she said. \"I've just put a penny in the\nchocolate slot machine—and it's empty! I've a good mind to write\nto the company.\"</p><p>Ashe felt as though he were listening to the strains of some\ngrand sweet anthem.</p><p>The small but sturdy porter, weary of his work among the milk\ncans, or perhaps—let us not do him an injustice even in\nthought—having finished it, approached them.</p><p>\"The cart from the castle's here.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In the gloom beyond him there gleamed a light</p>",
  "page-209": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">which had not been\nthere before. The meditative snort of a horse supported his\nstatement. He began to deal as authoritatively with Mr. Peters'\nsteamer trunk as he had dealt with the milk cans.</p><p>\"At last!\" said Joan. \"I hope it's a covered cart. I'm frozen.\nLet's go and see.\"</p><p>Ashe followed her with the gait of an automaton.</p><hr class=\"section\"><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Cold is the ogre that drives all beautiful things into hiding.\nBelow the surface of a frost-bound garden there lurk hidden\nbulbs, which are only biding their time to burst forth in a riot\nof laughing color; but shivering Nature dare not put forth her\nflowers until the ogre has gone. Not otherwise does cold suppress\nlove. A man in an open cart on an English Spring night may\ncontinue to be in love; but love is not the emotion uppermost in\nhis bosom. It shrinks within him and waits for better</p>",
  "page-210": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">times.</p><p>The cart was not a covered cart. It was open to the four winds of\nheaven, of which the one at present active proceeded from the\nbleak east. To this fact may be attributed Ashe's swift recovery\nfrom the exalted mood into which Joan's smile had thrown him, his\nalmost instant emergence from the trance. Deep down in him he was\naware that his attitude toward Joan had not changed, but his\nconscious self was too fully occupied with the almost hopeless\ntask of keeping his blood circulating, to permit of thoughts of\nlove. Before the cart had traveled twenty yards he was a mere\nchunk of frozen misery.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">After an eternity of winding roads, darkened cottages, and black\nfields and hedges, the cart turned in at a massive iron gate,\nwhich stood open giving entrance to a smooth gravel drive.

Joan was apparently in a gentle\nglow. Women seem impervious to cold.</p><p>The door opened. Warm, kitcheny scents came through it. Strong\nmen hurried out to take down the trunks, while fair women, in the\nshape of two nervous scullery maids, approached Joan and Ashe,\nand bobbed curtsies. This under more normal conditions would have\nbeen enough to unman Ashe; but in his frozen state a mere\ncurtsying scullery maid expended herself harmlessly on him. He\neven acknowledged the greeting with a kindly nod.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The scullery maids, it seemed, were acting in much</p>",
  "page-213": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the same\ncapacity as the attaches of royalty. One was there to conduct\nJoan to the presence of Mrs. Twemlow, the housekeeper; the other\nto lead Ashe to where Beach, the butler, waited to do honor to\nthe valet of the castle's most important guest.</p><p>After a short walk down a stone-flagged passage Joan and her\nescort turned to the right. Ashe's objective appeared to be\nlocated to the left. He parted from Joan with regret. Her moral\nsupport would have been welcome.</p><p>Presently his scullery maid stopped at a door and tapped thereon.\nA fruity voice, like old tawny port made audible, said: \"Come\nin!\" Ashe's guide opened the door.</p><p>\"The gentleman, Mr. Beach,\" said she, and scuttled away to the\nless rarefied atmosphere of the kitchen.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Ashe's first impression of Beach, the butler, was one of tension.\nOther people, confronted for the first time</p>",

Ashe, however, approaching him with a fresh eye, had the\nfeeling that this strain could not possibly continue and that\nwithin a very short space of time the worst must happen. The\nprospect of this did much to rouse him from the coma into which\nhe had been frozen by the rigors of the</p>",

Blandings Castle was one of the more important of England's\nshow places, and Beach accordingly had acquired a dignified\ninertia that almost qualified him for inclusion in the vegetable\nkingdom. He moved—when he moved at all—slowly. He distilled\nspeech with the air of one measuring out drops of some precious\ndrug. His heavy-lidded eyes had the fixed</p>",
  "page-216": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">expression of a\nstatue's.</p><p>With an almost imperceptible wave of a fat white hand, he\nconveyed to Ashe that he desired him to sit down. With a stately\nmovement of his other hand, he picked up a kettle, which simmered\non the hob. With an inclination of his head, he called Ashe's\nattention to a decanter on the table.</p><p>In another moment Ashe was sipping a whisky toddy, with the\nfeeling that he had been privileged to assist at some mystic\nrite. Mr. Beach, posting himself before the fire and placing his\nhands behind his back, permitted speech to drip from him.</p><p>\"I have not the advantage of your name, Mr.——\"</p><p>Ashe introduced himself.

I have but\nrecently recovered from an ingrowing toenail. I suffered greatly\nfrom my ingrowing toenail.

If he told the truth and\nconfessed that this was his maiden effort in the capacity of\ngentleman's gentleman, what would the butler think? There were\nobjections to each course, but to tell the truth was the easier\nof the two; so he told it.</p><p>\"Your first situation?\" said Mr. Beach. \"Indeed!\"</p>",

To be\nsure, he had advanced some objection to that course in their\nconversation at the offices of Mainprice, Mainprice & Boole; but\nmerely a silly, far-fetched objection. He wished he had had the\nsense to fight the point while there was time; but at the moment\nwhen they were arranging plans he had been rather tickled by the\nthought of becoming a valet. The notion had a pleasing\nmusical-comedy touch</p>",

  "page-223": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to break it\nsoon.

I have to go to the cellar.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Following his directions Ashe came after a walk of a few yards to\na green-baize door, which, swinging at his push, gave him a view\nof what he correctly took to be the main hall of the castle—a\nwide, comfortable space, ringed with settees and warmed by a log\nfire burning in</p>",
  "page-225": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">a mammoth fireplace. On the right a broad\nstaircase led to the upper regions.</p><p>It was at this point that Ashe realized the incompleteness of Mr.\nBeach's directions. Doubtless, the broad staircase would take him\nto the floor on which were the bedrooms; but how was he to\nascertain, without the tedious process of knocking and inquiring\nat each door, which was the one assigned to Mr. Peters? It was\ntoo late to go back and ask the butler for further guidance;\nalready he was on his way to the cellar in quest of the evening's\nwine.</p><p>As he stood irresolute a door across the hall opened and a man of\nhis own age came out. Through the doorway, which the young man\nheld open for an instant while he answered a question from\nsomebody within, Ashe had a glimpse of glass-topped cases.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Could this be the museum—his goal? The next moment the door,\nopening a few inches more, revealed</p>",
  "page-226": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the outlying portions of an\nEgyptian mummy and brought certainty. It flashed across Ashe's\nmind that the sooner he explored the museum and located Mr.\nPeters' scarab, the better. He decided to ask Beach to take him\nthere as soon as he had leisure.</p><p>Meantime the young man had closed the museum door and was\ncrossing the hall. He was a wiry-haired, severe-looking young\nman, with a sharp nose and eyes that gleamed through rimless\nspectacles—none other, in fact than Lord Emsworth's private\nsecretary, the Efficient Baxter. Ashe hailed him:</p><p>\"I say, old man, would you mind telling me how I get to Mr.\nPeters' room? I've lost my bearings.\"</p><p>He did not reflect that this was hardly the way in which valets\nin the best society addressed their superiors. That is the worst\nof adopting what might be called a character part. One can manage\nthe business well enough; it is the dialogue that provides the\npitfalls.</p>",
  "page-227": "<p>Mr. Baxter would have accorded a hearty agreement to the\nstatement that this was not the way in which a valet should have\nspoken to him; but at the moment he was not aware that Ashe was a\nvalet. From his easy mode of address he assumed that he was one\nof the numerous guests who had been arriving at the castle all\nday. As he had asked for Mr. Peters, he fancied that Ashe must be\nthe Honorable Freddie's American friend, George Emerson, whom he\nhad not yet met. Consequently he replied with much cordiality\nthat Mr. Peters' room was the second at the left on the second\nfloor.</p><p>He said Ashe could not miss it. Ashe said he was much obliged.</p><p>\"Awfully good of you,\" said Ashe.</p><p>\"Not at all,\" said Mr. Baxter.</p><p>\"You lose your way in a place like this,\" said Ashe.</p><p>\"You certainly do,\" said Mr. Baxter.</p>",
  "page-228": "<p>Ashe went on his upward path and in a few moments was knocking at\nthe door indicated. And sure enough it was Mr. Peters' voice that\ninvited him to enter.</p><p>Mr. Peters, partially arrayed in the correct garb for gentlemen\nabout to dine, was standing in front of the mirror, wrestling\nwith his evening tie. As Ashe entered he removed his fingers and\nanxiously examined his handiwork. It proved unsatisfactory. With\na yelp and an oath, he tore the offending linen from his neck.</p><p>\"Damn the thing!\"</p><p>It was plain to Ashe that his employer was in no sunny mood.\nThere are few things less calculated to engender sunniness in a\nnaturally bad-tempered man than a dress tie that will not let\nitself be pulled and twisted into the right shape. Even when\nthings went well, Mr. Peters hated dressing for dinner. Words\ncannot describe his feelings when they went wrong.</p>",
  "page-229": "<p>There is something to be said in excuse for this impatience: It\nis a hollow mockery to be obliged to deck one's person as for a\nfeast when that feast is to consist of a little asparagus and a\nfew nuts.</p><p>Mr. Peters' eye met Ashe's in the mirror.</p><p>\"Oh, it's you, is it? Come in, then. Don't stand staring. Close\nthat door quick! Hustle! Don't scrape your feet on the floor.\nTry to look intelligent. Don't gape. Where have you been all this\nwhile? Why didn't you come before? Can you tie a tie? All right,\nthen—do it!\"</p><p>Somewhat calmed by the snow-white butterfly-shaped creation that\ngrew under Ashe's fingers, he permitted himself to be helped into\nhis coat. He picked up the remnant of a black cigar from the\ndressing-table and relit it.</p><p>\"I've been thinking about you,\" he said.</p><p>\"Yes?\" said Ashe.</p>",
  "page-230": "<p>\"Have you located the scarab yet?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"What the devil have you been doing with yourself then?

  "page-232": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the Fourth Dynasty, presented\"—Mr. Peters\nchoked—\"presented by J. Preston Peters, Esquire! That's how\nyou're going to recognize it.\"</p><p>Ashe did not laugh, but he nearly dislocated a rib in his effort\nto abstain from doing so. It seemed to him that this act on Lord\nEmsworth's part effectually disposed of the theory that Britons\nhave no sense of humor. To rob a man of his choicest possession\nand then thank him publicly for letting you have it appealed to\nAshe as excellent comedy.</p><p>\"The thing isn't even in a glass case,\" continued Mr. Peters.\n\"It's lying on an open tray on top of a cabinet of Roman coins.\nAnybody who was left alone for two minutes in the place could\ntake it! It's criminal carelessness to leave a valuable scarab\nabout like that. If Lord Jesse James was going to steal my Cheops\nhe might at least have had the decency to treat it as though it\nwas worth something.\"</p>",
  "page-233": "<p>\"But it makes it easier for me to get it,\" said Ashe consolingly.</p><p>\"It's got to be made easy if you are to get it!\" snapped Mr.\nPeters. \"Here's another thing: You say you are going to try for\nit late at night.

  "page-234": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of my being\nin the museum?\"</p><p>\"Idiot! I don't mean that you're to say it if you're caught\nactually in the museum.

  "page-235": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">complaint differently\nAshe would in all probability have borne it without active\nprotest. He had been growing more and more annoyed with this\nlittle person who buzzed and barked and bit at him, yet the idea\nof definite revolt had not occurred to him. But his sufferings at\nthe hands of Beach, the butler, had reduced him to a state where\nhe could endure no further mention of stomachic linings. There\ncomes a time when our capacity for listening to detailed data\nabout the linings of other people's stomachs is exhausted.</p><p>He looked at Mr. Peters sternly. He had ceased to be intimidated\nby the fiery little man and regarded him simply as a\nhypochondriac, who needed to be told a few useful facts.</p><p>\"How do you expect not to have indigestion?

  "page-236": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">beardless youth\nat that—held Mr. Peters silent. He started convulsively, but he\ndid not speak. Ashe, on his pet subject, became eloquent.

  "page-237": "<p>\"Don't interrupt—confound you!\" shouted Ashe. \"Now you have made\nme forget what I was going to say.\"</p><p>There was a tense silence.

I'm through! You can get somebody else to do this job\nof yours for you.\"</p><p>The sudden sagging of Mr. Peters' jaw, the look of consternation\nthat flashed on his face, told Ashe he had found the right\nweapon—that the game was in his hands. He continued with a\nfeeling of confidence:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"If I had known what being your valet involved I wouldn't have\nundertaken the thing for a hundred thousand dollars.

I've retired\nfrom business.\"</p><p>He took another step toward the door. A shaking hand clutched at\nhis sleeve.</p><p>\"My boy—my dear boy—be reasonable!\"</p><p>Ashe was intoxicated with his own oratory. The sensation of\nbullyragging a genuine millionaire was new and exhilarating. He\nexpanded his chest and spread his feet like a colossus.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"That's all very well,\" he said, coldly disentangling himself\nfrom the hand. \"You can't get out of it like that.

Of course you were hasty;\nand as long as you abuse your digestion you will go on being\nhasty. I want something better than apologies. If I am to stop\nhere we must get to the root of things.

This enabled the butler to\ntake his place at the head of the table without fear of\ninterruption, except for the few moments when coffee</p>",
  "page-243": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was being\nserved.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Every night shortly before half-past eight—at which hour Mr.\nBeach felt that he might safely withdraw from the dining-room and\nleave Lord Emsworth and his guests to the care of Merridew, the\nunder-butler, and James and Alfred, the footmen, returning only\nfor a few minutes to lend tone and distinction to the\ndistribution of cigars and liqueurs—those whose rank entitled\nthem to do so made their way to the housekeeper's room, to pass\nin desultory conversation the interval before Mr. Beach should\narrive, and a kitchen maid, with the appearance of one who has\nbeen straining at the leash and has at last managed to get free,\nopened the door, with the announcement: \"Mr. Beach, if you please,\ndinner is served.\" On which Mr. Beach, extending a crooked elbow\ntoward the housekeeper, would say, \"Mrs. Twemlow!\" and lead the\nway, high and disposedly, down the passage, followed in order of\nrank by the rest</p>",

  "page-247": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">work. With each member of the aristocracy of\nhis new profession Ashe shook hands, and on each member he\nsmiled, until his facial and dorsal muscles were like to crack\nunder the strain.

  "page-273": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">his\nlordship's museum—\" Mr. Beach treasured the clipping in a\nspecial writing-desk.</p><p>He responded almost amiably to Ashe's questions. Yes; he had seen\nthe scarab—he pronounced it scayrub—which Mr. Peters had\npresented to his lordship. He understood that his lordship\nthought very highly of Mr. Peters' scayrub. He had overheard Mr.\nBaxter telling his lordship that it was extremely valuable.</p><p>\"Mr. Beach,\" said Ashe, \"I wonder whether you would take me to\nsee Lord Emsworth's museum?\"</p><p>Mr. Beach regarded him heavily.</p><p>\"I shall be pleased to take you to see his lordship's museum,\" he\nreplied.</p><hr class=\"section\"><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One can attribute only to the nervous mental condition following\nthe interview he had had with Ashe in his bedroom the rash act\nMr. Peters attempted</p>",
  "page-274": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">shortly after dinner.</p><p>Mr. Peters, shortly after dinner, was in a dangerous and reckless\nmood. He had had a wretched time all through the meal. The\nBlandings chef had extended himself in honor of the house party,\nand had produced a succession of dishes, which in happier days\nMr. Peters would have devoured eagerly. To be compelled by\nconsiderations of health to pass these by was enough to damp the\nliveliest optimist. Mr. Peters had suffered terribly. Occasions\nof feasting and revelry like the present were for him so many\nbattlefields, on which greed fought with prudence.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">All through dinner he brooded on Ashe's defiance and the horrors\nwhich were to result from that defiance. One of Mr. Peters' most\npainful memories was of a two weeks' visit he had once paid to\nMr. Muldoon in his celebrated establishment at White Plains. He\nhad been persuaded to go there by a brother</p>",
  "page-275": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">millionaire whom,\nuntil then, he had always regarded as a friend.

He knew\nthose health cranks who believed that all mortal ailments could\nbe cured by cold showers and brisk walks. They were all alike and\nthey nearly killed you. His worst nightmare was the one where he\ndreamed he was back at Muldoon's, leading his horse up that\nendless hill outside the village.</p><p>He would not stand it! He would be hanged if he'd stand it! He\nwould defy Ashe. But if he defied Ashe, Ashe would go away; and\nthen whom could he find to recover his lost scarab?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mr. Peters began to appreciate the true meaning of</p>",
  "page-276": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the phrase\nabout the horns of a dilemma. The horns of this dilemma occupied\nhis attention until the end of the dinner. He shifted uneasily\nfrom one to the other and back again. He rose from the table in a\nthoroughly overwrought condition of mind. And then, somehow, in\nthe course of the evening, he found himself alone in the hall,\nnot a dozen feet from the unlocked museum door.</p><p>It was not immediately that he appreciated the significance of\nthis fact. He had come to the hall because its solitude suited\nhis mood. It was only after he had finished a cigar—Ashe could\nnot stop his smoking after dinner—that it suddenly flashed on\nhim that he had ready at hand a solution of all his troubles. A\nbrief minute's resolute action and the scarab would be his again,\nand the menace of Ashe a thing of the past. He glanced about him.\nYes; he was alone.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Not once since the removal of the scarab had begun</p>",
  "page-277": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to exercise\nhis mind had Mr. Peters contemplated for an instant the\npossibility of recovering it himself.

The risk was too\ngreat to be considered for a moment; but here he was, in a\nposition where the risk was negligible!</p><p>Like Ashe, he had always visualized the recovery of his scarab as\na thing of the small hours, a daring act to be performed when\nsleep held the castle in its grip. That an opportunity would be\npresented to him of walking in quite calmly and walking out again\nwith the Cheops in his pocket, had never occurred to him as a\npossibility.</p><p>Yet now this chance was presenting itself in all its simplicity,\nand all he had to do was to grasp it. The door of the museum was\nnot even closed. He could see from where he stood that it was\najar.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He moved cautiously in its direction—not in a</p>",
  "page-278": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">straight line as\none going to a museum, but circuitously as one strolling without\nan aim. From time to time he glanced over his shoulder.

To support this\ntheory was the fact that the latter had taken his check book to\nLondon with him.

  "page-282": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">which may at any moment afflict the collector,\nblotting out morality and the nice distinction between meum and\ntuum, as with a sponge.

If Mr. Baxter recollects, he did not look long at the\nshoe. The picture on the retina of the eye consequently had not\ntime to fade.

The\nshoe-expert resumed his investigations in the basket. He went\nthrough it twice, but each time without success. After the second\nsearch he stood up and looked wildly about the room. He was as\ncertain as he could be of anything that the missing piece of\nevidence was somewhere within those four walls. There was very\nlittle cover in the room, even for so small a fugitive as a shoe.\nHe raised the tablecloth and peered beneath the table.</p><p>\"Are you looking for Mr. Beach, sir?\" said Ashe. \"I think he has\ngone to church.\"</p><p>Baxter, pink with his exertions, fastened a baleful glance upon\nhim.</p>",
  "page-418": "<p>\"You had better be careful,\" he said.</p><p>At this point the Earl of Emsworth, having done all the pottering\npossible in the restricted area, yawned like an alligator.</p><p>\"Now, my dear Baxter—\" he began querulously.</p><p>Baxter was not listening.

  "page-419": "<p>\"But where is the key?\"</p><p>Baxter thought for a moment.</p><p>\"Lord Emsworth,\" he said, \"I have my reasons for thinking that\nthis man is deliberately keeping the contents of this closet from\nme.

  "page-421": "<p>\"The deuce it is! Then it was a woman who stole the scarab? Is\nthat the way you figure it out? Bless my soul, Baxter, one\nwonders what women are coming to nowadays. It's all this\nmovement, I suppose. The Vote, and all that—eh? I recollect\nhaving a chat with the Marquis of Petersfield some time ago. He\nis in the Cabinet, and he tells me it is perfectly infernal the\nway these women carry on. He said sometimes it got to such a\npitch, with them waving banners and presenting petitions, and\nthrowing flour and things at a fellow, that if he saw his own\nmother coming toward him, with a hand behind her back, he would\nrun like a rabbit. Told me so himself.\"</p><p>\"So,\" said the Efficient Baxter, cutting in on the flow of\nspeech, \"what I wish to do is to break open this closet.\"</p><p>\"Eh?

  "page-423": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">in dumb disappointment.</p><p>\"Are you satisfied now, my dear Baxter,\" said the earl, \"or is\nthere any more furniture that you would like to break?

He was still trying to rally from the blow.\nA chance remark of Lord Emsworth's set him off on the trail once\nmore. Lord Emsworth, having said his say, had dismissed the\naffair from his mind and begun to potter again. The course of his\npottering had brought him to the fireplace, where a little pile\nof soot on the fender caught his eye. He bent down to inspect it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Dear me!\" he said. \"I must remember to tell Beach</p>",
  "page-424": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to have his\nchimney swept.

He was still\nconvinced that Ashe had hidden the shoe somewhere in the room,\nand, now that the closet had proved an alibi, the chimney was the\nonly spot that remained unsearched. He dived forward with a rush,\nnearly knocking Lord Emsworth off his feet, and thrust an arm up\ninto the unknown. The startled peer, having recovered his\nbalance, met Ashe's respectfully pitying gaze.</p><p>\"We must humor him,\" said the gaze, more plainly than speech.</p><p>Baxter continued to grope. The chimney was a roomy chimney, and\nneeded careful examination. He wriggled his hand about\nclutchingly. From time to time soot fell in gentle showers.</p><p>\"My dear Baxter!\"</p>",
  "page-425": "<p>Baxter was baffled. He withdrew his hand from the chimney, and\nstraightened himself. He brushed a bead of perspiration from his\nface with the back of his hand. Unfortunately, he used the sooty\nhand, and the result was too much for Lord Emsworth's politeness.\nHe burst into a series of pleased chuckles.</p><p>\"Your face, my dear Baxter! Your face! It is positively covered\nwith soot—positively! You must go and wash it. You are quite\nblack. Really, my dear fellow, you present rather an\nextraordinary appearance.

She had always told herself that she liked\nGeorge, that George was a dear old friend, that George amused and\nstimulated her; but she would have denied she was so wrapped up\nin George that the sight of him in trouble would be enough to\nspoil for her the finest day she had seen since she left America.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There was something not only startling but shocking in the\nthought; for she was honest enough</p>",

This was surely a matter\nthat called for thought. She proceeded, gazing down the while at\nthe perambulating George, to give it thought.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Aline's was not a deep nature. She had never pretended to herself\nthat she loved the Honorable Freddie in the sense in which the\nword is used in books. She liked him and she liked the idea of\nbeing connected with the peerage; her father liked the idea and\nshe liked her father. And the combination of these likings had\ncaused her to reply \"Yes\" when, last Autumn, Freddie, swelling\nhimself out like an embarrassed frog and gulping, had uttered\nthat memorable speech beginning, \"I say, you know, it's like\nthis, don't you know!\"—and</p>",
  "page-444": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">ending, \"What I mean is, will you\nmarry me—what?\"</p><p>She had looked forward to being placidly happy as the Honorable\nMrs. Frederick Threepwood. And then George Emerson had reappeared\nin her life, a disturbing element.</p><p>Until to-day she would have resented the suggestion that she was\nin love with George. She liked to be with him, partly because he\nwas so easy to talk to, and partly because it was exciting to be\ncontinually resisting the will power he made no secret of trying\nto exercise. But to-day there was a difference. She had suspected\nit at luncheon and she realized it now. As she looked down at him\nfrom behind the curtain, and marked his air of gloom, she could\nno longer disguise it from herself.</p><p>She felt maternal—horribly maternal. George was in trouble and\nshe wanted to comfort him.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Freddie, too, was in trouble. But did she want to comfort\nFreddie? No. On the contrary, she was already</p>",
  "page-445": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">regretting her\npromise, so lightly given before luncheon, to go and sit with him\nthat afternoon. A well-marked feeling of annoyance that he should\nhave been so silly as to tumble downstairs and sprain his ankle\nwas her chief sentiment respecting Freddie.</p><p>George Emerson continued to perambulate and Aline continued to\nwatch him. At last she could endure it no longer. She gathered up\nher letters, stacked them in a corner of the dressing-table and\nleft the room. George had reached the end of the terrace and\nturned when she began to descend the stone steps outside the\nfront door. He quickened his pace as he caught sight of her. He\nhalted before her and surveyed her morosely.</p><p>\"I have been looking for you,\" he said.</p><p>\"And here I am. Cheer up, George! Whatever is the matter? I've\nbeen sitting in my room looking at you, and you have been simply\nprowling. What has gone wrong?\"</p><p>\"Everything!\"</p>",
  "page-446": "<p>\"How do you mean—everything?\"</p><p>\"Exactly what I say. I'm done for.

I shall have to leave here\nto-morrow.\"</p><p>Aline's eyes were fixed on the blue hills across the valley, but\nshe did not see them. There was a mist between. She was feeling\ncrushed and ill-treated and lonely. It was as though George was\nalready gone and she left alone in an alien land.</p><p>\"But, George!\" she said; she could find no other words for her\nprotest against the inevitable.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"It's bad luck,\" said Emerson quietly; \"but I</p>",

His researches in detective\nfiction had given him the knowledge that detectives occasionally\nrelaxed their austerity when dealing with a deserving case. Even\nGridley Quayle could sometimes be softened by a hard-luck story.\nFreddie could recall half a dozen times when a detected criminal\nhad been spared by him because he had done it all from the best\nmotives.

  "page-489": "<p>\"I believe you. You're a blooming marvel! What first put you on\nmy track?\"</p><p>\"That,\" said Ashe, \"would take too long to explain.

The news of Aline Peters' elopement with George\nEmerson, carried beyond the green-baize door by Slingsby, the\nchauffeur, produced very much the same state of affairs in the\nservants' quarters at Blandings Castle.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was not only that Slingsby was permitted to penetrate into the\nhousekeeper's room and tell his story</p>",

James, the\nfootman—that pushing individual—actually shoved his way into\nthe room, and was heard by witnesses to remark to no less a\nperson than Mr. Beach that it was a bit thick.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And it is on record that his fellow footman, Alfred, meeting the\ngroom of the chambers in the passage outside, positively prodded\nhim in the lower ribs, winked, and said: \"What a day we're\nhaving!\" One has to go back to the worst excesses of the French\nRevolution to parallel these outrages. It was held by Mr. Beach\nand Mrs. Twemlow afterward that the social fabric of the castle\nnever fully recovered from this upheaval. It may be they took an\nextreme view of the matter, but it</p>",
  "page-504": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">cannot be denied that it\nwrought changes. The rise of Slingsby is a case in point. Until\nthis affair took place the chauffeur's standing had never been\nsatisfactorily settled. Mr. Beach and Mrs. Twemlow led the party\nwhich considered that he was merely a species of coachman; but\nthere was a smaller group which, dazzled by Slingsby's\npersonality, openly declared it was not right that he should take\nhis meals in the servants' hall with such admitted plebeians as\nthe odd man and the steward's-room footman.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Aline-George elopement settled the point once and for all.\nSlingsby had carried George's bag to the train. Slingsby had been\nstanding a few yards from the spot where Aline began her dash for\nthe carriage door.
