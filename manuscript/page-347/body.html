powder, two tablespoonfuls butter, a tablespoonful flour, one

salt, quarter teaspoonful pepper.'"</p><p>"Go on."</p><p>"'Way of Preparing: Cream the butter and flour and add the

pepper. Remove the lobster meat from the shells and cut into
half-inch cubes.'"</p><p>"Half-inch cubes," sighed Mr. Peters wistfully. "Yes?"</p><p>"'Add the latter to the sauce.'"</p></div> </div>
