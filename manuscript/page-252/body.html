<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">out under escort of a wizened little man with a horseshoe
pin in his tie, whose name, in company with nearly all the others
that had been spoken to him since he came into the room, had
escaped Ashe's memory.</p><p>"You were nearly making a bloomer!" said Miss Willoughby
brightly. "You must be absent-minded, Mr. Marson—like his
lordship."</p><p>"Is Lord Emsworth absent-minded?"</p><p>Miss Willoughby laughed.</p><p>"Why, he forgets his own name sometimes! If it wasn't for Mr.
Baxter, goodness knows what would happen to him."</p><p>"I don't think I know Mr. Baxter."</p><p>"You will if you stay here long. You can't get away from him if
you're in the same house. Don't tell anyone I said so; but he's
the real master here. His lordship's secretary he calls himself;
but he's really everything rolled into one—like the man in the
play."</p></div> </div>
