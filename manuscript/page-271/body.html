Threepwood did write me letters. Of course I destroyed them long
ago."</p><p>"But weren't you running the risk in coming here that he might
recognize you? Wouldn't that make it rather unpleasant for you?"</p><p>"I never met him, you see. He only wrote to me. When he came to
the station to meet us this evening he looked startled to see me;
so I suppose he remembers my appearance. But Aline will have told
him that my name is Simpson."</p><p>"That fellow Judson said he was brooding. I think you ought to
put him out of his misery."</p><p>"Mr. Judson must have been letting his imagination run away with
him. He is out of his misery. He sent a horrid fat man named
Jones to see me in London about the letters, and I told him I had
destroyed them. He must have let him know that by this time."</p></div> </div>
