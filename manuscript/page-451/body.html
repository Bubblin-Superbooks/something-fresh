allowed herself to pity George Emerson.</p><p>The silence lengthened. Aline could find nothing to say. In her
present mood there was danger in speech.</p><p>"We have known each other so long," said Emerson, "and I have
told you so often that I love you, we have come to make almost a
joke of it, as though we were playing some game. It just happens
that that is our way—to laugh at things; but I am going to say
it once again, even though it has come to be a sort of catch
phrase. I love you! I'm reconciled to the fact that I am done
for, out of the running, and that you are going to marry somebody
else; but I am not going to stop loving you.</p><p>"It isn't a question of whether I should be happier if I forgot
you. I can't do it. It's just an impossibility—and that's all
there is to it. Whatever I may be to you, you are part of me, and
you always will be part of me. I might just as well try to go on
living without breathing as living without loving you."</p></div> </div>
