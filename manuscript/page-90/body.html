his mind, walks briskly into a lamppost and comes back to the
realities of life with a sense of jarring shock, Lord Emsworth
started, blinked and returned to consciousness. Far away his mind
had been—seventy miles away—in the pleasant hothouses and shady

extending toward him a small, dingy-looking something.</p><p>He took it and looked at it. That, apparently, was what he was
meant to do. So far, all was well.</p><p>"Ah!" he said—that blessed word; covering everything! He
repeated it, pleased at his ready resource.</p><p>"A Cheops of the Fourth Dynasty," said Mr. Peters fervently.</p><p>"I beg your pardon?"</p><p>"A Cheops—of the Fourth Dynasty."</p></div> </div>
