crazy about scarabs. Ever since I quit business, you might say
that I have practically lived for scarabs."</p><p>"Though it sounds like an unkind thing to say of anyone," said
Ashe. "Incidentally, what are scarabs?" He held up his hand.
"Wait! It all comes back to me. Expensive classical education,
now bearing belated fruit. Scarabaeus—Latin; noun, nominative—a
beetle. Scarabaee—vocative—O you beetle! Scarabaeum—
accusative—the beetle. Scarabaei—of the beetle. Scarabaeo—to
or for the beetle. I remember now. Egypt—Rameses—pyramids—
sacred scarabs! Right!"</p><p>"Well, I guess I've gotten together the best collection of
scarabs outside the British Museum, and some of them are worth
what you like to me. I don't reckon money when it comes to a
question of my scarabs. Do you understand?"</p><p>"Sure, Mike!"</p></div> </div>
