lick of paint, which bears what is perhaps the most modest and
unostentatious announcement of its kind in London. The grimy

during the flat-racing season, and had been known to lend money,
Scotland Yard did not find out much about Mr. Jones and presently
dismissed him from its thoughts.</p></div> </div>
