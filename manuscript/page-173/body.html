<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>There remained the telling of Joan Valentine; for it was
obviously impossible not to tell her. When you have
revolutionized your life at the bidding of another you cannot
well conceal the fact, as though nothing had happened. Ashe had
not the slightest desire to conceal the fact. On the contrary, he
was glad to have such a capital excuse for renewing the
acquaintance.</p><p>He could not tell her, of course, the secret details of the
thing. Naturally those must remain hidden. No, he would just go
airily in and say:</p><p>"You know what you told me about doing something new? Well, I've
just got a job as a valet."</p><p>So he went airily in and said it.</p><p>"To whom?" said Joan.</p><p>"To a man named Petersâ€”an American."</p><p>Women are trained from infancy up to conceal their feelings. Joan
did not start or otherwise express emotion.</p></div> </div>
