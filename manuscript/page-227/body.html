statement that this was not the way in which a valet should have
spoken to him; but at the moment he was not aware that Ashe was a
valet. From his easy mode of address he assumed that he was one
of the numerous guests who had been arriving at the castle all
day. As he had asked for Mr. Peters, he fancied that Ashe must be
the Honorable Freddie's American friend, George Emerson, whom he
had not yet met. Consequently he replied with much cordiality
that Mr. Peters' room was the second at the left on the second
floor.</p><p>He said Ashe could not miss it. Ashe said he was much obliged.</p><p>"Awfully good of you," said Ashe.</p><p>"Not at all," said Mr. Baxter.</p><p>"You lose your way in a place like this," said Ashe.</p><p>"You certainly do," said Mr. Baxter.</p></div> </div>
