This was Mr. Peters' town house, and he had come to it by
invitation to look at Mr. Peters' collection of scarabs. To be

Arabs?</p><p>Lord Emsworth smiled. Scarabs, of course. You couldn't collect
Arabs. He wondered idly, as he rang the bell, what scarabs might

collecting, and he was very pleased to have the opportunity of
examining these objects; whatever they were. He rather thought

constituted that they can only take their leisure in the shape of
a change of work. To this fairly numerous class belonged Mr. J.
Preston Peters, father of Freddie's Aline. And to this merit—or
defect—is to be attributed his almost maniacal devotion to that
rather unattractive species of curio, the Egyptian scarab.</p></div> </div>
