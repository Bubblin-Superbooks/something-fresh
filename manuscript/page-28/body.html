Indian temple, which is supposed to bring death to whoever
possesses it. The hero gets hold of it, and the priests dog him
and send him threatening messages. What else could it be?"</p><p>Ashe could not restrain his admiration.</p><p>"This is genius!"</p><p>"Oh, no!"</p><p>"Absolute genius. I see it all. The hero calls in Gridley Quayle,
and that patronizing ass, by the aid of a series of wicked
coincidences, solves the mystery; and there am I, with another
month's work done."</p><p>She looked at him with interest.</p><p>"Are you the author of Gridley Quayle?"</p></div> </div>
