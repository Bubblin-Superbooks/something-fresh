<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Freddie. I was a real pal, as I understood
it, because I would have to wait for my money. The fact was, he
explained, his old governor had cut off his bally allowance."</p><p>"You're simply trying to poison my mind against him; and I don't
think it's very nice of you, George."</p><p>"What do you mean—poison your mind? I'm not poisoning your mind;
I'm simply telling you a few things about him. You know perfectly
well that you don't love him, and that you aren't going to marry
him—and that you are going to marry me."</p><p>"How do you know I don't love my Freddie?"</p><p>"If you can look me straight in the eyes and tell me you do, I
will drop the whole thing and put on a little page's dress and
carry your train up the aisle. Now, then!"</p><p>"And all the while you're talking you're letting my carver get
away," said Aline.</p></div> </div>
